We now divide it by the number of inhabitants of the house \n\n## Conference mode launched in the foreground\n\nThe feature is now open to everyone on the home page \n\nIt allows friends, colleagues and workgroups to calculate their footprint together in an interactive way.\n\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-06-14 17-10-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/121915284-5ea79800-cd33-11eb-8530-fe334eef9cd7.png)\n\nA new guide allows to understand the principle before starting.\n\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-06-14 17-11-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/121915462-8434a180-cd33-11eb-850f-9b7fd909639b.png)\n\nRoom names in French are automatically generated to avoid having to think of a name.\n\nOther bugs in the /conference mode have been solved.",

Instead of counting 50kg CO2e for a t-shirt bought for 100€, we count the t-shirt's footprint.\n\nIn return, it is up to you to catalog what you buy in general each year (or on average each year).

We have removed it.\n\n## 🐛 shared car bug\n\nIn short, we were significantly overestimating the footprint of the shared car rental.\n\nWe now attribute a share of the vehicle's construction to each person who rents a car to get around. We were making the mistake of attributing _all of the_ construction to him ",

The others are coming soon!\n\n## Brand new figures for the food footprint\n\nWe have improved the footprints of the lunch and dinner dishes \n\nFirst, we have improved the calculation of the emission factor of the most important component of the meals, meat and fish. Instead of a simple average, we now do an average weighted by national consumption (for example, for the dish \"meat 1\", pork and chicken are no longer equally important) \n\nSecondly, there was a global update of agribalysis in October, which corrected overestimated emission factors. We have updated our figures with these \n\n[More info](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1525).\n\n[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/200906087-5748cab9-d053-48dd-b169-3038dcf50fa2.png)](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/alimentation/plats/viande-1)\n\n## Improved navigation during and after the test\n\nIt is [now easier](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/677) to navigate through the categories and answers already given after the test \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/193876373-fd942951-afb3-40ec-8316-480b9bdf7241.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/193876420-5203196f-54af-42fb-b61b-9e2822da9a59.png)\n\nIn the same vein, a new `Find My Simulation` button appears on the home page, and the progress of the test in % on the profile page. [More info](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/672).\n\n## A new page to explain our fossil dependency\n\nA [new page](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/p%C3%A9trole-et-gaz) to explain the stakes of reducing our oil and gas consumption.

MicMac Web was no longer updated, so a new version of the interface had to be launched, one that was more modern, interactive, easy to evolve, and made the calculations completely transparent \n\nThis repository contains the complete calculation model of Our Climate Gestures, in the form of YAML [publicodes](https://publi.codes) files.\n\nThe tool is in _beta_ version: it is usable and already informative, but we have already identified many unsatisfactory points \n\n* the total is not the 11.2 tons expected\n* the numerical part is not complete, the footprint is underestimated\n* the only question for the diet is very disappointing\n* etc.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/89622912-0e9ab200-d894-11ea-9226-c4af37549cd7.png)",

This is part of our strategy to open up to audiences not yet aware of these topics.\n\n[The Ministry of the Environment is demoing this here](https://twitter.com/i/status/1488059482647236608)\n\n## Seasonal, local food 🌻 🚛\n\nFrom Agribalyse, we have developed climate footprint variation models corresponding to seasonal and local diets \n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/140048614-299fc659-6c87-441c-ab91-4b79e7c44b11.gif)\n\nTo our knowledge, these improvements are groundbreaking work! You will see that these \"options\" have little influence if your diet is not already strongly vegetarian \n\n## New screen to help you enter mileage while driving ⌨️ 🛣️\n\nYou may have noticed that it's hard to answer the question \"How many miles do you drive each year?\" all at once \n\nSo have we: so we've designed a form to help with that entry \n\n![Aide à la saisie km voiture - démo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151338682-c79c82d3-4582-4981-98ab-401dc8c81206.gif)\n\nBig bonus: this form also avoids estimating a vehicle fill rate, which is usually a very risky task \n\n## Improvements to the \"action\" path 🎯\n\n* two new actions to switch to seasonal and local food\n* we have improved the action to reduce the temperature of your home: we now ask you your current temperature\n* a new action to go vegan\n* we separated the actions into different ranges, from \"more than a ton\" to \"less than 10kg\", and finally to \"unquantified actions\".\n\n## Gas prices 🔥\n\nYou will surely have seen it: gas prices are exploding in France. Between +40% and +110% in a few months. So we have revised upwards our tool to help estimate kWh from €/month \n\nTo do so, we have reimplemented the gas bill at the regulated rate, including the various taxes and subscriptions that modify this figure.\n\n## New profile page\n\nA small button appears on the home page, it indicates that you already have data on nosgestesclimat.fr.

The environmental impact of digital is mainly related to manufacturing [(70% for example for a smartphone)](https://librairie.ademe.fr/cadic/5311/infographie-preferer-smartphone-reconditionne.pdf?modal=false)._\n\n### Small screens\n\nWe continue to work to support small screens \n\nHere are the improvements on iPhone5 SE \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875622-2991b5a6-69c9-4c04-9422-48c727cc81af.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875673-c96e2098-22bb-4e71-b993-3c121fd008a6.png)\n\nTo do this, we have optimized the footprint distribution graph, integrating the texts in the bars. It has also been animated, which makes it much easier to understand the impact of choices in the input \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852263-5fb7fe31-e13e-4ce5-96a8-4794d19f5ce7.png)\n\n### Hosting the site\n\nWe [asked](https://answers.netlify.com/t/low-carbon-european-cdn/48784) our host (Netlify), if it would be possible for them to implement a server in France so that our users could see their site served from France, rather than from Germany currently \n\n## Coming in 2022\n\nSee our roadmap for the calculation model [here](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/projects/1)",

This is what makes it particularly robust to changes, as we don't painstakingly order questions by hand, and we don't recode entanglements like \"if the user said they live in an apartment, then don't ask them about the lawnmower\": it's all handled for us \n\nThe management of \"mosaic\" questions (the \"heating\" checkboxes or the choice of lunch and dinner menus) has been improved, and now resides directly in [the model](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/docs/mosaic.md), alongside the other questions! \n\nWhat's the point? This allows contributors who don't want to bother with Javascript (and other coder considerations) to modify the questions in a very easy to access language ",

    "body": "![C'est à l'assemblée nationale dans le 7ème arrondissement de Paris qu'est voté chaque année le budget de l'État](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/205978955-88a0ad61-244c-4afb-89a9-600eef3a5f1c.jpg)\n\nIf you have ever done a carbon footprint test, you may have noticed a rather surprising category: utilities. About 1 ton out of the French average of 10 tons, it may not seem like much... However, for those who adopt a rather low-carbon lifestyle, and more generally in relation to the objective of 2 tons of individual footprint (remember that the important thing is not the objective but the [transition scenario](https://datagir.ademe.fr/blog/budget-empreinte-carbone-c-est-quoi/)), 1 ton can legitimately look like an elephant in the room! \n\nIn this article, we tell you all about this famous \"public services\" or now \"societal services\" item in UCS: how it is calculated, what it is composed of, and how we just used these numbers to make a **✨ new version of the calculation model of nosgestesclimat.fr** \n\n## The average French person emits 8.9 tons (November 2022)\n\nFrance, like many other countries, has set commitments to reduce its climate footprint \n\nTo achieve this, we obviously need to know _where we are_ today and how things are evolving each year \n\nThis is the task of the Ministry of Ecology's [Data and Statistical Studies Department](https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/), which [estimates it at 8.9 tons per person in 2021](https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/lempreinte-carbone-de-la-france-de-1995-2021?rubrique=27&dossier=1286)\n\nHow is this figure calculated? The explanation of the calculation is [transparent but relatively difficult to understand](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/files/9980633/methodologie%5Fempreinte%5Fcarbone%5Foctobre2021%5F0.pdf), so we will simply explain the principle of this clever calculation \n\nBasically, to calculate a climate footprint, you have to start from a physical reality. We have to calculate the real greenhouse gas emissions (well, estimate it) of a concrete action: for example, we know that burning 1 liter of gasoline in a car emits about [2.7 kg of CO2](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/transport/voiture/thermique/empreinte-au-litre). Then, we can count the liters of diesel burned by French semi-trailers, by barges on rivers, by boats, planes, etc \n\nThe problem then, is to calculate the footprint of other sectors, which do not directly burn these fossil fuels. For example, a hospital buys wooden furniture but does not manufacture or transport it itself. The furniture is cut up in a factory, which bought it. For this, a truck delivered wooden boards to them. This wood was treated by the chemical industry, and produced by the forestry industry (the management of forest wood), which uses diesel chainsaws, etc \n\nThe administration does not have a precise description of all these transactions (kg of wood, volume of oil and paint, etc.), but it does have the exchanges in € between all these sectors, at an aggregated level over the year, called macro. Thanks to these monetary exchanges, a matrix calculation allows us to attribute to each sector the carbon footprint of its added value!\n\nThese calculations are made periodically. The latest accurate version is for the year 2017, and the latest (less accurate) estimate is for 2021 \n\n## Defining the perimeter of a base assigned to each French person\n\nBy summing up the footprint of all these sectors, divided by the population of the country, this gives [the](https://base--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/empreinte-SDES?PR=1584) so-called \"macro\" [footprint](https://base--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/empreinte-SDES?PR=1584) per person \n\nIn parallel, the calculation model of nosgestesclimat is a compilation of so-called \"micro\" models: you are asked a multitude of questions to reconstruct _your carbon footprint_ from physical consumption data.\n\n> These are two perspectives on the same physical reality, two very different methods producing two figures, which fortunately converge around 9 tons of CO2e \n\nThese two methods are very different but they are also complementary: indeed, the analysis by consumption cannot capture all the emissions of a French person. If the micro method of nosgestesclimat allows to easily calculate the footprint of your car kilometers, it is unable to estimate the footprint of public services that you use in a diffuse way all year long, as well as commercial services such as the fiber and mobile internet network that most of the population benefits from in a latent way (admittedly in a variable way). It is therefore necessary to adopt a hybrid model, which mixes micro and macro.\n\n> The header photo of this article illustrates the problem: it is easy to estimate the climate footprint of the truck, the car and the motorcycle. But what about the footprint of this regularly re-bituminized road? What about the maintenance of the road signs? Of the footprint of the operation of the national assembly itself? \n\nThe objective is then to define the perimeter of these complementary worlds in order to avoid double counting, and thus obtain the final value of the constant societal services, the sum of public services and commercial services, attributed to each French person.\n\n![Recording 2022-12-12 at 18 08 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/207108876-1334c2b0-8275-43d5-a899-81d04c2230d9.gif)\n\n## A first calculation\n\nWe have therefore analyzed the macro footprint data, [shared by the SDES](https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/la-decomposition-de-lempreinte-carbone-de-la-demande-finale-de-la-france-par-postes-de-consommation), by sector, line by line, to include a share, from 0 to 100%, to the societal services footprint \n\n> It should be remembered that the objective is always to**obtain orders of magnitude**: it is not a question of claiming a result to the nearest 10 kg of CO2\\. In this respect, it should be remembered that our climate objectives target a 90% reduction in our footprint \n\nThe line \"Public administration and defense\" is of course automatically included in the public services: the citizen has no influence on these governmental positions other than through his vote and his public commitment \n\nThings get more complicated for example for the item \"🏗️ construction\": it includes many diverse activities benefiting the whole society, yet we do not have the details of their carbon footprint. An allocation is therefore made on the basis of the turnover of the sub-branches and sub-sub-branches [published by INSEE](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4226067?sommaire=4226092), these are the % that you can see appearing in our documentation \n\n_Learn more about the breakdown by turnover of the SDES carbon data_ \n\n> The data provided by the SDES gives a carbon footprint corresponding to what is consumed on the French territory by economic branch (e.g.: E36 = water distribution network = 677 kTCO2e) or by group of economic branches (e.g.: F41\\_43 = Construction = 54116 kTCO2e) For this data, there is a first level of aggregation that we have chosen to disaggregate according to the share of turnover [of the branch](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4226067?sommaire=4226092) in the grouping proposed by the SDES (e.g.: for F41\\_43, we have F41=25%, F42=13.5%, F43=61.5%)\n> \n> Some data are secret, we have made the assumption that these data were also secret for the calculation of the national carbon footprint. In the absence of additional information, we chose not to consider them in these decomposition calculations.\n> \n> To go even further, we sometimes needed a higher level of precision by looking at the economic sub-branches. Indeed, if we take the example of E38 relating to waste collection, only sub-branches E3812 and E3822, concerning hazardous waste, were to be included in the public services. We have therefore also used the decomposition by turnover to highlight the carbon intensity associated with the sub-branches in question within E38.\n\nFor market services, we tried to include in the baseline footprint those consumptions that are relatively universal (e.g., everyone has to buy home insurance) or those that are not yet captured by our micro models (e.g., consumption of telecom services) but may one day be \n\nIf you are interested, you can explore our documentation that explains and justifies this allocation via the [utilities](https://base--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/services-publics?PR=1584) and [market](https://base--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/services-marchands?PR=1584) services pages. It is quite \"expert\", we did the best we could for a first version, your feedback will be valuable.\n\n## The result\n\nHere is a photograph of our hybrid model \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/207576758-03cfbc96-a6a2-4817-a4cb-4c4562342783.png)\n\n⚠️ Beware, do not see in this graph a reliable average value of the climate footprint of a French person, [contrary to the SDES figure of 8.9t](https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/lempreinte-carbone-de-la-france-de-1995-2021?rubrique=27&dossier=1286), but simply the anatomy of our hybrid calculation model. The values are likely to change regularly, in full transparency \n\nThe objective of Nos Gestes Climat remains to estimate the footprint associated with the lifestyle of a real person. By the way, the objective of the next versions is precisely to cover many items that are currently left out 🐕️⛴️🛵⚡️🏡. See you soon! ",

This mode can be particularly interesting in the context of a workshop or an event, a [facilitator guide](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/guide) is available to help you!\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632300-dba6d437-a9bd-44b3-afc3-874c1e7307d6.png)\n\n* **The**arrival of this new mode is accompanied by an additional feature that allows you to add a few questions to collect additional information as an introduction to the test. For example, this can be useful to organize a survey at the scale of an organization while allowing to filter the results by type of respondent (status...), age, place of living (while taking care not to compromise the standards of RGPD). We have also worked on the security of the surveys to avoid the introduction of vulnerabilities in our database via this feature. You can find all the info in our [documentation](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/documentation-contexte)!\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632420-ada9f5c5-b1ab-45a5-b0f7-05d95df2b3bc.png) \n* **In**the previous version, any user who logged in to the survey was displayed in the graph. Some people counted as 1 participant without even having taken the test (with a score corresponding to the default values) and the ghost visits distorted the results (especially the average value!). This is no longer the case in this version since the data displayed is filtered by excluding users who completed less than 10% of the test questions. In case the survey is customized (see above), an additional filter is applied to display only the participants who completed the context questions.\n\n## A new metric: oil! 🛢\n\nTo better visualize the amount of oil we consume in our lives, we decided to add to Our Climate Gestures the number of corresponding full tanks, in addition to the CO₂e. For the moment, this metric is only reported to direct emissions related to oil (travel, oil heating ...). The way to both highlight our dependence on these fossil fuels but also to better visualize the impact of actions we can put in place: the number of fills speaks more than the tons of CO₂e, so swipe on the end screen to see your oil impact!\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171646402-b2d769d1-0626-4a0d-8903-90b7727383e0.png) \n\n## Improvements to the calculation model 🧮\n\n* **Added caravan & motorhome**There are now more choices in Our Climate Gestures for going on vacation! Caravans and motor homes have found their place. Attention, for the caravan, the number of kilometers traveled is well to include in the kilometers traveled by car. More information on the methodology in issue #1317![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/160854704-aa5b1010-e8f9-43cb-966b-ba80e6a8f731.png)\n* **Change in the passenger ratio**With the arrival of the assistance in entering the kilometers in [the last release](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut%C3%A9s/las-n%C3%A9ous), a question remained as to the choice of the vehicle's fill rate applied to attribute the depreciation to the different users of the car. The details are available in issue #1337 and in the [note of the \"passenger ratio\" variable](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/blob/8fe4b633502fe52dda7eccdc0e9db01b9f677e57/data/transport/transport%20.%20voiture.yaml#L53)\n* **More choice of fuels**Diesel (B7 or B10), gasoline (E5 or E10) or E85 gasoline (biofuels), you can choose! However, beware of the message sent to the user when he selects biofuels. The carbon impact is certainly lower, but the emission factor is particularly uncertain: the issues related to land use are not taken into account! A notification is therefore displayed to explain this issue! All the info and discussions are in the corresponding issue #1396!\n* **Improvement of the digital mosaic**New objects have been added for the digital objects mosaic #1359 :  \n   * 🎵 bluetooth speaker  \n   * 🔊 voice speaker  \n   * ⌚️ connected watch  \n   * 🕹 living room console  \n   * 🎮 portable console\n* **New heating modes**It is now possible to choose the heat pump (#1360)! Thoughts are underway to add heat networks as well.\n\n## Improvements in actions 💪\n\n* **A \"Buy an electric car\" action makes its appearance**. Proposed in case you already own a car, this action allows users to realize the impact (positive or negative) of buying a new or used electric car according to the kilometers driven per year.  \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171641150-ec39e53c-2565-43ae-8379-1b97691c8f03.png)\n* **Adding mesaidesvelo.fr in the actions**Adding a link to [mesaidesvelo.fr](https://mesaidesvelo.fr/) in the relevant actions. The tool is developed by @mquandalle, who is a developer on mon-entreprise.fr, and mesaidesvelo.fr is already integrated on the official website <https://www.1jeune1solution.gouv.fr/>.  \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171675160-9cd5c968-d2ba-473a-8ca1-8e316ec041f2.png)\n\n## A new way to contribute 👥\n\nContributing is made easier for non-devs contributors! Repositories have been configured to allow you to modify or add new features in real time via a development environment directly in your browser. We explain everything in the [Gitpod tutorial](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#vous-voulez-contribuer-comme-un-pro)! \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171634543-25c6a773-849c-4931-9aef-a96df5506334.png) \n\n## New resources 📚\n\nTo help you during your animations but also to allow you to question your own results, [guide sheets are online](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/guide)! \n\n**Full Changelog:** <https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/compare/1.5.0...1.6.0>",

It's only a minor release.\n\n* your last simulation done on the browser, if there is one is automatically loaded 🧙♂️\n* we have separated the calculation of the aircraft footprint ✈ into three questions, by mail type: short, medium, long. The calculation is more reliable. We also ask the question \"do you fly\" beforehand to free those who are not concerned by this emission item\n* we added a FAQ ❔ on the /contribute page. Indeed, we have many (many) feedbacks, often similar.\n* we improved the car questions 🚗, especially to avoid talking about \"your\" car when the user said he didn't have one\n* the 🚗 emoji was not suitable to represent the transportation category, leading some people who use only a little car, but other means of transportation to believe a bug in our model. It is now this one: 🚦",

This is especially thoughtful for collocates who may each have their own amount in mind.\n\nWe improved the texts of the questions on cars, and better documented the calculations.",

We've redesigned it entirely, bringing it closer to a mini-game where the goal is to reduce your footprint \n\n![ngc-action-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139829768-5759d428-1e0d-4c7d-9fd3-682dbebb1b90.gif)\n\nThis is just the beginning: we have already planned the [next steps](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/359) to make engagement even easier.\n\nWe're also introducing _personas_: typical profiles you can select to experience the action journey as a given citizen \n\n## The menu 🐟️\n\nWe've received dozens of requests to integrate a fish menu on the diet choice screen.

Many new features on food will follow \n\n## A new menu for the application\n\nNosgestesclimat is designed to be used on mobile as on desktop. The mobile version now has a permanent menu at the bottom of the screen, and the desktop version of a new arrangement in two columns, with a menu also present on the left \n\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-11-02 11-31-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830463-203c8896-0eda-49ad-ba45-be1a19e180de.png)\n\nThis new menu makes the application more accessible, and it's just one of many accessibility improvements we have [planned](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/350).\n\n## The French average is now 9 tons!\n\nUnfortunately, this does not reflect unexpected efforts, but an improvement of the calculation method of the Ministry of the Environment \n\nThe good news is that the French administration is taking the issue seriously, improving its calculations and explaining the differences in a scientific way \n\nDetailed explanations [here](https://twitter.com/maeool/status/1453282887583866885).\n\nSo why do we show an average of 9.8 tons in the simulator? Because our calculation is made using another method than the government one, complementary. More info [here](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/365#issuecomment-957321261).\n\n## Conference mode improvements 🏟️\n\nThis collective mode of using ourclimategests is more and more used. To facilitate the sharing of the link at the beginning of the conference, we generate a super QRCode that you just have to project or send by email![Capture d’écran du 2021-11-02 11-32-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830597-63fe1856-5622-4c52-b7f4-23ccbfaa6bd9.png)\n\nAnother improvement is that we exclude from the group's results simulations that have resulted in a footprint that is too high, above 100 tons. This limit will be configurable soon \n\n## Technical improvements 🐇\n\nWe continue to lighten the site, removing a graphic animation library (react-spring) and better cutting the conference mode from the rest of the application \n\nOf course, many reported bugs have also been fixed.",

The issue of cycling makes its appearance in the simulator, and in the \"go to work other than by car\" action, which replaces \"go to work by public transport\". Walking 🚶♀️ and other modes are not left out obviously 🛴![Capture d’écran du 2021-02-08 15-42-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/107234732-4097f700-6a24-11eb-9f54-ff64cf66183f.png)\n\nWe'll let you guess the impact this quesiton has on the results ;) \n\nWe have also improved the input guides (e.g. number of houses: is it with or without me?)\n\n🤳 The phone question has been revised, now that all recent phones are larger than 5 inches, and to take into account the 'no smartphone' option.\n\n🔥🌲 The heating in steres of wood question becomes more relevant: it's counted in steres, not kWh. We will continue to improve the other entries soon (wood in pellets, fuel oil).\n\n## Other improvements\n\nNew features (like this one you are reading) now appear directly on [https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveautés,](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut%C3%A9s) it's still more accessible than [on github](https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/releases) 🙂 \n\n🐛 Several quite important bugs have been solved thanks to your feedback (end of simulation always at 11 tons, default value input -> no \"next\" button, etc.)\n\n## Our roadmap\n\nNow that the \"issues\" onget is clearer, it was time to put online our roadmap on the simulator / calculation model side, it is in the [\"Projects\" section](https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/projects/1). Everything is indicative, but it allows you to know what are our current topics \n\n> As for the interface, [this is the place](https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-climat/milestones) to go to follow the progress.",
